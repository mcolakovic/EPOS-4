**Live Demo:**
See live demo of our plugin at [showhide.bunte-giraffe.de](http://showhide.bunte-giraffe.de "http://showhide.bunte-giraffe.de"). User: demo, password: demo.

Show-Hide / Collapse-Expand allows you to easily manage the amount of content shown to user upon entering your website. It will free your pages from clutter and give your website a stylish minimalistic look and feel. You will find it handy for grouping content, composing FAQs, collapsing long lists and expanding them on click, providing hidden answers to questions, organizing your widgets more efficiently, and lots more. Inserting a shortcode is done via a handy tinyMCE button in your WordPress Editor. You will configure the look of your button/hyperlink on the fly and will be able to change it later using the provided shortcode parameters. Why don't you give it a try?

Please feel free to post your questions in the support threads of this plugin, we will be glad to help you with any issues.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I see a demo of your plugin before installing it? =

See live demo of our plugin at [showhide.bunte-giraffe.de](http://showhide.bunte-giraffe.de "http://showhide.bunte-giraffe.de"). User: demo, password: demo.

= How can I insert the shortcode?  =

Go to the post or page you wish to edit and switch to Visual tab. You will see the Collapse-Expand button in your Editor. Please click it and customize the needed parameters. When you click OK, the shortcode will be inserted.

= Can I insert the same shortcode into a post and a sidebar widget? =

Yes, you can use the same shortcode multiple times on the same page.

= How do I nest shortcodes inside one another? =

For inserting level 2 shortcode, please check the "This shortcode should be nested in another shortcode" checkbox or use [bg_collapse_level2] shortcode. For level 3, please use [bg_collapse_level3] shortcode.

= Will my other shortcodes work inside your shortcode? =

Yes, we did our best to make them work. Some shortcodes (like Google Maps plugins shortcodes) might behave strangely, we recommend using our Google Maps - Simple Pins plugin if you need to hide your Google maps. If you have any issues, please let us know in the support thread.

= I don't want to use animation, can I turn it off? =

Sure. Go to Tools->ShowHide/CollapseExpand screen (Settings tab), clear the Enable jQuery UI effects checkbox and set Custom animation speed (ms) to 0.
